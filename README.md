My attempt at scraping NBA data

There are two Jupyter notebooks in this repository that create a cleaned and merged dataset of the 30 NBA teams. The first notebook scrapes and cleans data from Wikipedia on the teams' championships, number of MVPs, win streaks, and regular season records. The second notebook merges the data into one final dataset.

The intermediary datasets created in the process of building the final dataset are housed within the Prelim Datasets folder. The final merged dataset is in the Final Dataset folder in both a pickle file and a csv.
